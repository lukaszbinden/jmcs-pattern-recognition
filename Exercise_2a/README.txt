Pattern Recognition SS 2018 - Exercise 2a
=========================================

We ran a grid-search to find good parameter values for C (in 10**5 .. 10**9) and Gamma (in 2**-5 .. 2**-2). 

We found that the value of C had almost no effect on the precision while the smallest Gamma value clearly led to the best accurcy of ~98% (cf plot).
